Doctors that specialize in obstetrics and gynecology are called obstetricians.They are prepared to handle medical interventions and surgical procedures for both common and high-risk pregnancies.Obstetricians frequently handle situations where there are pre-existing medical issues or prospective difficulties.They work together with other professionals to deliver care in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.A certified nurse-midwife (CNM), a certified midwife (CM), or a certified professional midwife (CPM) are all examples of trained professionals known as midwives.They place an emphasis on a more all-encompassing and minimally invasive approach to pregnancy and labor.Personalized, one-on-one care and support are frequently given by midwives during pregnancy and birth.They are able to provide care in hospitals, birthing facilities, and some even do home births",
